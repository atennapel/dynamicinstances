-- As an example we define a forking combinator.

-- In the usual formulation of
-- the simply typed lambda calculus:
\f g h x . f (g x) (h x)

-- In the fine-grain call-by-value
-- simply typed lambda calculus:
\f g h x . (y <- g x; z <- h x; f y z)
-- In this system we have to be explicit
-- about the order of evaluation.
