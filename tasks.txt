- Clean up problem statement and proposed solution in Chapter 1
- Better introduction for background
  / mention pros of pure functions
  / mention what effects I am talking about
  / more about static and dynamic instances
- Maybe no exception comparison
/ Specify language more precisely (inspired by Koka)
- Mention that we are using deep handlers
- Explain commute better
- Write examples for static and dynamic instances
- Different color for return in the handler case
x Fix page breaks in code
x Simplify types by removing thunks
x Separate handlers
x Add our system examples before theory
- More examples for dynamic instances
