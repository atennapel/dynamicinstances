My master thesis on dynamic instances for algebraic effects and handlers will form here...

Read here (WIP): https://github.com/atennapel/dynamicinstances/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf

coq - contains formalizations of different type systems <br/>
documents - different bits and pieces <br/>
examples - contains some examples of dynamic instances <br/>
js - contains an untyped Javascript implementation of dynamic instances <br/>
hs - incomplete haskell implementation of the system <br/>
thesis - the final thesis <br/>
