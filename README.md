My master thesis on dynamic instances for algebraic effects and handlers will form here...

Thesis (WIP): https://github.com/atennapel/dynamicinstances/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf <br/>
Coq formalization (WIP): https://github.com/atennapel/dynamicinstances/blob/master/coq/existentials-1op.v <br/>
Haskell implementation (WIP): https://github.com/atennapel/dynamicinstances/blob/master/hs/EffDynamic.hs

coq - formalizations of different type systems <br/>
documents - different bits and pieces <br/>
examples - contains some examples of dynamic instances <br/>
js - contains an untyped Javascript implementation of dynamic instances <br/>
hs - implementations of the type system in Haskell <br/>
thesis - the final thesis <br/>
